# üõ†Ô∏è Refurbished Laptop Project

I found an old laptop in my garage and decided to refurbish it for cybersecurity learning and practice. I took on this project to better understand hardware maintenance and repair. It took just over an hour to swap out parts and over 3 hours to decide which OS to install.

## üîß Hardware Changes

The first thing I did was open the laptop to inspect the existing hardware. After examining it, I decided to replace the RAM, hard drive, thermal paste, and battery.

- **RAM**: The laptop originally had a single 8GB stick. I replaced it with two new 8GB 1600MHz sticks for a total of 16GB.
- **Hard Drive**: The original 500GB HDD was partly corrupted and nearing the end of its life. I upgraded it to a 500GB SSD for faster performance and reliability.
- **Thermal Paste**: The thermal paste on the CPU and some chips was dried out. I removed the heatsink, cleaned both the heatsink and chips with isopropyl alcohol, and applied a proper amount of new thermal paste.
- **Battery**: The battery was dead, so I sourced a compatible replacement based on the part number and installed it easily.

## üíª Choosing an Operating System

I decided early on that I wanted to install Linux, since my main desktop runs Windows. Using Linux would allow me to gain experience with a different OS and reduce the load on the older hardware.

I tested several Linux distributions to find the best fit for my needs:

- Linux Mint  
- Debian  
- Kali Linux  
- Ubuntu  
- Arch Linux  
- Pop!_OS

I ultimately settled on **Pop!_OS** for now, as it was easy to set up and had the features I was looking for. I plan to switch to **Debian** in the future. I‚Äôm currently using this laptop for learning and general research, not for penetration testing or as a target machine.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project taught me a lot‚Äîfrom basic hardware maintenance to Linux installation and distro comparison. It‚Äôs been a valuable hands-on learning experience, and I‚Äôm proud of the progress I've made. I plan to continue tinkering with this laptop and truly make it my own.
